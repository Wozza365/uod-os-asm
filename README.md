# uod-os-asm
First stage of x86 OS project built entirely in x86 Assembly

Completed as part of the final year Systems Programming module for my Bachelor's degree at the University of Derby.
All tasks in the specification (included) were completed.

Grade received: **85%**

Feedback received: 
```
You do have some duplication and some of the functions are very small, 
meaning that the number of bytes for the call itself is nearly as big as the function.

Your code is well laid out , structured and readable. 
```

This was my first ever project written in Assembly and it required an entirely new way of thinking when it comes to programming.
I feel I completed the assignment to a very high standard with some minor internal issues that could be resolved through refactoring.
